# Grunt Powered
## My App Template

Not just for apps! Useful for dynamic sites, too.

## What I Do?

Check it:

    npm install && bower install
    grunt

That'll get you going. When you want to hack on your thing, just `grunt` again.


## Options

You can set `PORT=<port_number>` and `HOST=<ip_address_or_hostname>` when you
call `grunt`, like so:

    PORT=3001 HOST=127.0.0.1 grunt
